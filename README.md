## Flow Summary

. The java class is configured to 
	- have the hbase-site.xml, core-site.xml & hdfs-site.xml in classpath 
	- read a property file for jdbc url, query and name of the column to read
. hbase-site.xml, core-site.xml & hdfs-site.xml tell the program to use KERBEROS auth instead of SIMPLE

. JDBC url tells program the keytab and principal to use for KERBEROS auth

. JVM argument tell the location of KDC via krb5.conf file and tell program on how to authenticate the user 


## Things to know

. JDBC URL Format 

. Windows Client vs Mac Client

# Note

Setup tested on HDP2.5.3


# Usage 

## Setup
	. Add following files from your environment 
		- auth/krb5.conf 
		- auth/smokeuser.headless.keytab  (Keytab for the actual end user - name whatever you want) 
		- conf/hbase-site.xml
		- conf/core-site.xml
		- conf/hdfs-site.xml
		- get phoenix client jar - phoenix-4.7.0.2.6.0.0-597-client.jar - and add it to ./lib/
		
	. Update the configuration file 
		- Update ./conf/app.conf and update the JDBC Url, Query and Column to read
